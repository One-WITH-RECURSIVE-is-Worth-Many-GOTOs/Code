-- PL/SQL-based Barnes-Hut N-Body Simulation
-- (for a static set of bodies, separated by walls)
--
-- Uses SQL (WITH RECURSIVE) to compute the Barnes-Hut quad-tree
-- in table barneshut(node,bbox,parent,mass,center)
-- in which each quadrant is decorated with is total mass (mass)
-- and center point of mass (center). Points on opposite sides
-- of a wall do not affect each other.
--
-- Define aggregates, operations, comparisons on PostgreSQL points
\i points.sql


-- Overall containing area for all bodies
\set area box(point(0,0), point(1000,1000))


-- Number of bodies
\set N :iterations

-- Populate area with N random bodies

-- Number of walls
